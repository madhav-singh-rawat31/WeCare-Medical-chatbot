# WeCare-Medical-ChatBot

A medical Chat-bot to identify general diseases such as cold, cough, headache etc.
   
   To easily detect diseases, we are designing a Chatbot system, this work explores prediction of diseases by taking various symptoms related to a disease. For this purpose, we use different datasets, we apply various Machine Learning classification and ensemble Techniques to predict diseases. Machine Learning is a method that is used to train computers or machines explicitly. Various machine learning Techniques provide efficient result to collect knowledge by building various classification and ensemble models from collected dataset. Such collected data can be useful to predict diseases. Various techniques of Machine Learning can capable to do prediction, however itâ€™s tough to choose best technique.
